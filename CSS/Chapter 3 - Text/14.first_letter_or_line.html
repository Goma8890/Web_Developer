      Percentages: The default size of text in browsers is 16px. So a size of
      75% would be the equivalent of 12px, and 200% would be 32px. If you create
      a rule to make all text inside the body element to be 75% of the default
      size (to make it 12px), and then specify another rule that indicates the
      content of an element inside the body element should be 75% size, it will
      be 9px (75% of the 12px font size). ems: an em is equivalent to the width
      of a letter m.
