    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <p>
      In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get
      around the royal gardens faster...
    </p>
    <p class="example">
      Constructed almost entirely of wood, the draisine weighed 22 kg and had no
      pedals but what it lacked in practicality, it made up for with speed. On
      its maiden voyage, the bicycle covered 13 kilometres in less than an hour.
      Unsurprisingly, the following year, 1818 saw the Baron obtain a patent,
      inspiring manufacturers from other parts of Europe to create their own
      contraptions, calling them “dandy horses.”

      Denis Johnson made refinements to this model and during the summer of 1819
      the “hobby-horse” became the craze and fashion in London society. Several
      parts were made of metal, which allowed the vehicle to be lighter than the
      continental version.
