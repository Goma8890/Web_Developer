    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him
        get around the royal gardens faster the bicycle covered 13 kilometres in
        less than an hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Constructed almost entirely of wood, the draisine weighed 22 kg and had
        no pedals but what it lacked in practicality, it made up for with speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Denis Johnson made refinements to this model and during the summer of
        1819 the “hobby-horse” became the craze and fashion in London society.
