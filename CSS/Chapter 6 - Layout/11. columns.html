    <h1>The Evolution of the Bicycle</h1>
    <div class="column1of2">
      <h3>The first Bicycle</h3>
      <p>
        In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him
        get around the royal gardens faster the bicycle covered 13 kilometres in
        less than an hour. Unsurprisingly, the following year, 1818 saw the
        Baron obtain a patent, inspiring manufacturers from other parts of
        Europe to create their own contraptions, calling them “dandy horses.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Constructed almost entirely of wood, the draisine weighed 22 kg and had
        no pedals but what it lacked in practicality, it made up for with speed.
        On its maiden voyage, the bicycle covered 13 kilometres in less than an
        hour. Unsurprisingly, the following year, 1818 saw the Baron obtain a
        patent, inspiring manufacturers from other parts of Europe to create
        their own contraptions, calling them “dandy horses.”

        Denis Johnson made refinements to this model and during the summer of
        1819 the “hobby-horse” became the craze and fashion in London society.
        Several parts were made of metal, which allowed the vehicle to be
        lighter than the continental version.
