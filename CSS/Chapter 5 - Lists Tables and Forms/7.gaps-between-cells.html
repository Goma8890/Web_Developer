<!-- The border-spacing property 
allows you to control the 
distance between adjacent cells. 
By default, browsers often leave 
a small gap between each table 
cell, so if you want to increase 
or decrease this space then 
the border-spacing property 
allows you to control the gap.
The value of this property is 
usually specified in pixels. You 
can specify two values if desired 
to specify separate numbers for 
horizontal and vertical spacing.
When a border has been used 
on table cells, where two cells 
meet, the width of lines would be 
twice that of the outside edges. 
It is possible to collapse adjacent 
borders to prevent this using the 
border-collapse property. 
Possible values are:
collapse
Borders are collapsed into a 
single border where possible. 
(border-spacing will be 
ignored and cells pushed 
together, and empty-cells
properties will be ignored.)
separate
Borders are detached from each 
other. (border-spacing and 
empty-cells will be obeyed.) -->
