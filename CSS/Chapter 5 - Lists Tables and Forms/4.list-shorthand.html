    <h1>Quotes from Edgar Allan Poe</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>I have great faith in fools; self-confidence my friends call it.</li>
      <li>All that we see or seem is but a dream within a dream.</li>
      <li>
        I would define, in brief, the poetry of words as the rhythmical creation
        of Beauty.
      </li>
    </ul>

<!-- As with several of the other CSS 
properties, there is a property 
that acts as a shorthand for list 
styles. It is called list-style, 
and it allows you to express 
the markers' style, image and 
position properties in any order. -->
