<!-- 
    The value of this property is 
most often specified in pixels 
(although it is also possible to 
use percentages or ems). If a 
percentage is used, the padding 
is a percentage of the browser 
window (or of the containing box 
if it is inside another box).
 -->
<!-- 
    Please note: If a width is 
specified for a box, padding is 
added onto the width of the box.
 -->
<!-- 
     You can specify different values 
for each side of a box using:
padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left
  -->
<!-- 
    Or you can use a shorthand 
(where the values are in 
clockwise order: top, right, 
bottom, left):
padding: 10px 5px 3px 1px;
 -->
