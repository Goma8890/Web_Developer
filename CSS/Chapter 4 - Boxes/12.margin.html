<!-- The margin property controls 
the gap between boxes -->
<!-- Please note: If the width of a box 
is specified then the margin is 
added to the width of the box. -->
<!-- You can specify values for each 
side of a box using:
margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left -->
<!-- You can also use the shorthand 
(where the values are in 
clockwise order: top, right, 
bottom, left):
margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px; -->
<!-- Sometimes you might see the 
following, which means that the 
left and right margins should be 
10 pixels and the top and bottom 
margins should be 20 pixels:
margin: 10px 20px; -->
<!-- (This same shorthand shown 
above can also be applied to 
padding.) -->
