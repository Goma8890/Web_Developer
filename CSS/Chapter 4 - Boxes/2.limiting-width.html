          The Clavinet is an electrically amplified clavichord invented by Ernst
          Zacharias and manufactured by the Hohner company of Trossingen, West
          Germany, from 1964 to 1982. The instrument produces sounds by a rubber
          pad striking a point on a tensioned string, and was designed to
          resemble the Renaissance-era clavichord.
