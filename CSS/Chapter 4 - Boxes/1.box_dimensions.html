<!-- 
    The most popular ways to 
    specify the size of a box are 
    to use pixels, percentages, or 
    ems.  
-->
<!-- 
    Traditionally, pixels have 
    been the most popular method 
    because they allow designers to 
    accurately control their size
-->
<!-- 
     When you use percentages, 
    the size of the box is relative to 
    the size of the browser window 
    or, if the box is encased within 
    another box, it is a percentage of 
    the size of the containing box
-->
<!-- 
    When you use ems, the size 
    of the box is based on the size 
    of text within it.
